    placement: " Place the tree outside, year-round, in a bright location with lots of sunlight. The Juniper cannot live indoors. During the winter protect the tree once temperatures drop below 15 °F (-10 °C). Some species change their foliage color during frosty periods to a purplish brown which is a part of their internal frost protection mechanism. Don’t worry they will turn green again in spring.",
    fertilizing: "Use normal organic fertilizer pellets every month during the growing season or a liquid fertilizer every week. If you’d like to see strong growth you can apply some higher nitrogen levels in the spring.",
    wiring: "Junipers produced for Bonsai are often heavily wired when they are very young. Dramatically twisted shapes are very popular and correspond with the natural shapes that used to grow in the Japanese mountains. Junipers can be bent aggressively, but be sure to wrap branches with raffia or tape for protection. Use caution when bending areas with deadwood as those parts do break easily. If they are large and old, you can split the deadwood to bend the more flexible living parts. The foliage pads should be wired and fanned out after thinning, to let light and air get in, otherwise, the inner parts of the foliage pads will die, and dense pads also increase the risk of pest infestation. Aesthetically, we want unobstructed structures to avoid the juniper from looking like broccoli.",
    watering: "Be careful not to overwater, as the juniper’s roots don't like soil wetness. Before you water, the soil should slightly dry. Misting the tree can be done regularly, especially after the tree has been repotted because it benefits from air humidity.",
    pruning: "To develop the foliage pads, long shoots that stick out of the silhouette can be pinched or cut at the base with sharp scissors throughout the growing season. Do not trim the juniper like a hedge because the removal of all growing tips will weaken the tree and the cut will turn the needles brown. When the foliage pads become too dense they must be thinned out with sharp scissors at the base. The Juniper Bonsai is generally a strong tree that also withstands aggressive pruning very well. But it cannot bud again from bare tree parts, so take care that there is some foliage left on every branch you wish to keep alive.",
    repotting: " Repot the Juniper Bonsai tree once every two years using a basic, or slightly more draining soil mixture. Very old trees can be repotted at longer intervals. Do not prune the roots too aggressively.",
    propagation: "If junipers are well cared for and placed in an ideal location they are very resistant to pests. Make sure not to allow foliage pads to get too dense otherwise, pests can settle in them more easily. During winter the junipers must be kept in a place with enough light and they must be checked for pests regularly even in winter. Junipers can sometimes get infested with spider mites, juniper scale, juniper aphids, and juniper needle miners as well as juniper webworms. Traditional insecticide/miticide sprays will help but if you want to get rid of pests, you should investigate why the tree was prone to infestation. Fungal rust diseases are a big problem. Juniper species have different levels of susceptibility to rust fungus. Some are even considered resistant to fungal rust diseases. As a rule of thumb, the blue-green junipers are more resistant than those with yellowish-green foliage. The Japanese junipers are also not infested often. You can find files that list many juniper species and cultivars and their susceptibility/resistance level to rust fungus on the internet. The rust fungus infests the junipers permanently and cannot be cured. It causes swellings that erupt with brown galls. During winter, particularly in rainy weather, the galls produce large, orange, gelatin-like tendrils, full of spores that infest the leaves of pear trees or hawthorn/crabapples. You can identify the fungus when you see orange spots on the pear leaves. In late summer brownish proliferations grow from the bottom-sides of the leaves which release spores that infest junipers. While the pear trees in most cases are not fatally affected – they are newly infected each year, and they can even be treated successfully with a fungicide. An infected juniper normally cannot be cured. The visibly infested branches die in most cases and the fungus can emerge on other tree parts. Removing the parts with the swellings and galls is no guarantee that the fungus will not reappear. Some people have a different opinion, but it’s best to burn rust-infested juniper immediately or put it into the garbage instead of your compost heap.",

    placement: "The trident maple likes a sunny airy place, but during the hottest summer weeks better protect it from scorching sunlight in the afternoon. In winter don't expose it to temperatures below 23° F (-5° C). It is a good idea to place the trident maple bonsai in a frost-free greenhouse or cold room for winter protection.",
    fertilizing: "During the growing season fertilize the tree once a month with solid organic fertilizer or every week with a liquid product.",
    wiring: "Younger branches and twigs can be wired and shaped quite well during winter dormancy, but check and remove the wire in time. Because of the strong growth wire can scar the bark very soon after the spring shoots have emerged. Guy wires are a good option to position stiff older branches.",
    watering: "Trident maples grow vigorously and consume a lot of water during the growing season. Always water in time, but do not overwater. Don't use very calcareous water, rain water is preferable if it can be obtained.",
    pruning: "New shoots in spring are usually allowed to grow until they have developed several leaf pairs and then they are shortened leaving just one pair. The apex tends to grow stronger than the lower branches, so balance the tree's growth by pruning the top more and letting weaker branches catch up. New shoots appear during the entire growing season and must be shortened continuously. On mature bonsai, pinching the young shoots very early can be necessary, to prevent the finer twigs of the outer canopy from thickening. Pruning of large branches or trunks should be done in summer when the cut wounds begin to heal immediately. Vigorous trident maples can close even larger wounds within a few years. Always seal wounds with cut paste to avoid fungi entering and to prevent die-back of the bark.
    Healthy compact trees can be defoliated partly or totally in summer, in regions with long warm growth periods even several times a year, to promote delicate ramification and smaller leaves and prevent inner twigs from dying from lack of light. On trees which are not defoliated still the largest leaves can be removed at any time. Autumn, when the leaves fall, is a good time to shorten the twigs and remove those which have grown in odd directions and all but two growing from the same point. The winter buds of trident maple bonsai are tiny and sometimes you might need a magnifying glass to see in which direction they point to decide where to cut, in order to make the new shoots grow into the desired direction in the following year.",
    repotting: "The trident maple should be repotted every two or three years in early spring, large old specimen less often. The roots grow strongly and can be pruned heavily. Use a well-draining soil mix with a pH value between 5 and 7.",
    propagation: "Trident maples can be grown from seeds, cuttings or air-layers which root easily. For more detailed information on these techniques, try our Bonsai tree care section.",
    disease: "Vigorous trident maples are hardly attacked by pests and diseases. Aphids, scale, caterpillars or spider mites can sometimes occur and powdery mildew or leaf spot fungi. Use a specific pesticide in these cases. Take care to seal cut wounds immediately to prevent Verticillium and other harmful fungi from entering. Root rot can occur when the tree is overwatered. Frequent watering with calcareous water can cause chlorosis."

    placement: " The ficus Bonsai tree is an indoor tree that does not endure frosty conditions. It can be kept outside in the summer as long as temperatures are above 60°F (15°C). It requires a lot of light, preferably full sunlight, so be sure not to place it in a shady location. The temperature should be kept relatively constant. Figs can endure low humidity due to their thick, waxy leaves, but they prefer higher humidity and need extremely high humidity to develop aerial roots.",
    fertilizing: "Fertilize every two weeks during summer, and every four weeks during winter if the growth doesn't stop. Liquid fertilizer can be used as well as organic fertilizer pellets.",
    wiring: "Wiring and bending thin to medium Ficus branches is easy due to their flexibility, but you should check the wires regularly as they can cut into the bark very quickly. Strong branches should be shaped with guy-wires because they can be left on the tree for a much longer period.",
    watering: "The Ficus should be watered normally, which means it should be given water generously whenever the soil gets slightly dry. The Bonsai Ficus prefers room temperature soft water and it can tolerate occasional over, or underwatering. We advise daily misting to maintain humidity, but too much misting can create fungal problems. The warmer the placement of the fig during winter the more water it needs. If it’s kept in a cooler place it only needs to be kept slightly moist.",
    pruning: "Regular pruning is necessary to retain the tree’s shape. Prune back to 2 leaves after 6-8 leaves have grown. Leaf pruning (defoliation) can be used to reduce leaf size, as some Ficus Bonsai species normally grow large leaves. If a considerable thickening of the trunk is desired, the Ficus can be left to grow freely for one or two years. The strong cuts that are necessary afterward don't affect the Ficus' health and new shoots will grow from old wood. Larger wounds should be covered with cut paste. ",
    repotting: "Repot your Ficus tree during the spring, every other year, using a basic Bonsai soil mixture. Ficus tolerates root-pruning very well.",
    propagation: "Cuttings can be planted at any time of the year, but they have the highest success rate during mid-summer growth. Air-layering will work best during spring, in April through May. In most cases, springtime is the best time for planting Ficus seeds.",
    disease: "Fig species are quite resistant against pests, but they are still susceptible to several issues depending on their location, and time of year, especially in the winter. Dry air and a lack of light weakens the Bonsai Ficus and often result in leaf drop. In poor conditions like these, they are sometimes infested with scale or spider mites. Placing customary insecticide sticks into the soil or spraying insecticide/miticide will get rid of the pests, but a weakened Ficus tree’s living conditions must be improved. Using plant lamps 12 to 14 hours a day, and frequently misting the leaves will help in the recovery process."

The Chinese boxwood  can be kept indoors but it prefers to be placed outside during the summer. For the winter the Chinese boxwood should be taken into a cool room with temperatures around 50°F / 10° C and enough light.",
    fertilizing: "Use solid organic fertilizer every month or a liquid fertilizer every week during the growing season. Don't fertilize the common boxwood during winter dormancy. The Chinese boxwood, which will not be completely dormant in its winter place, should be fertilized once a month in winter.",
    wiring: "When the boxwood is wired you must take care not to damage the delicate beige bark. Wire marks will be visible for a long time.",
    watering: "In summer the boxwood needs a lot of water, but it can withstand short dry periods. Avoid excess soil wetness. As the ideal pH value for the boxwood is 7 to 8, most normal tap water of good quality can be used.",
    pruning: "Trim the new shoots leaving one or two pairs of leaves. If the canopy becomes very dense the leaves should be thinned out in order to let light get in, prevent the inner twigs from dying and encourage back-budding. Common boxwood tolerates hard pruning and extensive deadwood sculpturing very well.",
    repotting: "Repot the boxwood every two to five years depending on its age and size. Boxwoods tolerate root pruning well. The soil mix should have a pH value of 7 to 8. You can add some pumice or lime rock gravel to your normal soil mix.",
    propagation: "The boxwood can be propagated from cuttings and air-layering. Best results are achieved in spring.",
    disease: "The boxwood can be attacked by fungal diseases (box blight or phytophthora root rot in wet soil, for example), nematodes, scale, boxwood mite, boxwood leafminer or boxwood psyllid. There are specific pesticides for most pests and diseases and it can be a good idea to ask a professional gardener for help in serious cases. Recently the boxwood moth has become a severe problem in Europe. Its long green caterpillars can skeletonize a boxwood plant very quickly. From bonsai trees the caterpillars can be collected by hand. Pesticides based on Neem oil or Bacillus thuringiensis are also effective against boxwood moth caterpillars."

    placement: "The cherry needs a sunny place which is protected from strong winds. During the hottest summer time it can be wise to provide some partial shade. A cool winter dormancy period of at least three months is required. Cherries are frost-hardy, but should be protected from extremely low temperatures, especially when they are planted in small bonsai pots.",
    fertilizing: "During the growth period, use a solid organic fertilizer once a month or a liquid fertilizer every week. Use a balanced product and avoid high nitrogen fertilizers for mature trees you want to flower.",
    wiring: "Wiring can be done best when there are no leaves on the tree. Old branches are quite stiff and brittle but they can be shaped with guy wires in many cases. Younger twigs are flexible and can be shaped easily with wire. You can also wire the new shoots during the growing season.",
    watering: "Cherry trees need a lot of water during the growing season and the rootball must not dry out, especially while flowers and fruit develop. On the other hand waterlogged rootballs will rot, so always ensure proper drainage. Use rainwater if possible, as cherries don't like very calcareous water.",
    pruning: "The cherry bonsai is not easy to keep in shape. After flowering the older branches can be selected and shortened, if necessary, but take care to leave leaf buds on branches you want to keep. Let the new shoots grow freely for some time. If they are trimmed too early, they often die back. The flower buds for the next season develop in late summer. In autumn the long shoots can be shortened leaving two to five nodes. In winter or early spring, before the new growth appears, you can prune larger branches and, if necessary, wire the tree. Branches which are cut too short might die back after flowering if they don't have leaf buds left. Prunus incisa however buds more reliably than other cherry species.",
    repotting: "Repot the Bonsai cherry every two or three years, older trees less often, in early spring before the flowers open. The roots of young specimen can be pruned considerably, but those of mature bonsai must be treated more gently and pruned only moderately. Cutting off thick woody roots can be dangerous for old cherry trees. Use a well-draining soil mix with a pH value of 5,5 to 6,5.",
    propagation: "The cherry can be propagated from seed, cuttings, by air-layering and grafting. Seedlings do not inherit the mother plant's characteristics in most cases. Hardwood cuttings can be taken in spring before the buds open, semi-hardwood cuttings in summer. Most cultivars that are offered in garden centers are grafted and often the rootstock grows faster than the scion which results in a ugly swelling.",
    disease: "Unfortunately cherry trees can be attacked by a lot of different pests and diseases. Aphids, scale, caterpillars, mealy bugs, gall mites and spider mites can affect the cherry as well as fungal diseases like powdery mildew, leaf spot, rust, crown and root rot and verticillium wilt, or bacterial diseases like canker and black knot. Cherry rasp leaf is caused by a virus. In those cases use a specific pesticide or in difficult cases ask a professional gardener for help. Frequent watering with calcareous water can cause chlorosis."

The male and female trees must be placed very near to each other to make sure they have the same growing conditions, especially in spring, so that both genders will flower at the same time. The Winterberry needs a lot of sunlight for producing its fruit, but should be protected from intense heat and sun during the hottest summer days. Birds like the berries and steal them as soon they begin to turn red. So you have to protect the trees, maybe in some kind of birdcage, if you want to enjoy the beautiful sight of the red fruits on bare twigs in autumn and winter. The Japanese Winterberry tolerates frost but should be protected from very low temperatures when it is planted in a bonsai pot.",
    fertilizing: "Use a balanced liquid fertilizer once a week during the growing season. You can also apply solid organic fertilizer.",

It requires a lot of natural light so it should be placed next to a window where it gets the best light. It thrives in temperatures around 70 °F (20 °C) so be sure not to allow the temperature to drop much lower. If the climate permits, you can place your Carmona outside during the summer months as long as the nights are warm enough. Winter months can be a bit more tricky. There are limited hours of daylight and heating systems produce dry air which does affect the tree. To account for winter conditions you can use a plant lamp for light. To regulate humidity fill a large tray with wet gravel or foamed clay and place it under the pot. If you open the windows during the winter months, make sure the Fukien Tea is not exposed to cold or frosty air.",
    fertilizing: "Solid organic fertilizer works well for the Fukien Tea Bonsai due to its sensitive roots. Liquid fertilizers can also be used in carefully measured dosage and only on moist soil. Feed the tree well from spring to autumn, following the directions for use, and less often during winter.",
    wiring: "Young shoots are tender and flexible so they are easy to trim or wire. Mature twigs and branches are hard and brittle, so use appropriate tools for pruning and be gentle when you want to wire and bend them.",
    watering: "It is critical to Keep the Fukien Tea tree moist, but be careful not to overwater because wet soil can also harm it. Water your tree generously as soon as the soil surface gets dry, but it must not be left in excess water.",
    pruning: "The Fukien tea tree handles pruning very well, and regular trimming will make the tree grow dense branch structures.",
    repotting: "Repot the Fukien Tea tree every two years early in the springtime. Because of its sensitive root system, root pruning must be done with care. Be sure, to use a soil mixture that both drains well and retains moisture because the Fukien Tea tree is sensitive to drought and excess wetness. Use a mixture of Akadama with a little humus and pumice.",
    propagation: "Use seeds or cuttings in summer.",
    disease: "Under inadequate conditions, the Carmona Bonsai can suffer from spider mites, scale, and whiteflies. Using insecticide sticks or insecticide sprays helps, but for long-term success, it's important to provide plenty of natural light and the right amount of humidity. Watering with hard water can cause the leaves to show signs of chlorosis. Treat chlorosis with iron fertilizer. In rare cases, fungal diseases can enter through fresh wounds.

Wisterias are frost hardy when they are growing in the ground, but the roots need protection when they are planted in containers. A cold but frost-free greenhouse, garage or shed is a good winter place for a wisteria bonsai tree.",
    fertilizing: "Apply solid organic fertilizer once a month or use a liquid fertilizer every week during the growing season or even both. The wisteria grows strongly and likes to be fed well, but use fertilizers which are not too high in nitrogen. The wisteria can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and too much nitrogen would promote leaf growth instead of flowers.",

    pruning: "Hard pruning is best done in early spring or after flowering. Let the tendrils grow until July and then cut them back. Don't cut off the short shoots on which the flower buds sit. At a close look you can distinguish the flower buds from the leaf buds. When the canopy gets too dense in summer and the inner twigs suffer from lack of light you can thin out the leaves but it is not advisable to totally defoliate the wisteria. Don't let too many seed pods develop because they take a lot of energy from the tree.",
    repotting: "Repot younger wisterias every two years and older ones every three to five years in spring before the buds open. They tolerate root pruning well but on old trees you should not risk too much. Wisterias flower better when they get a bit root-bound. A standard soil mix works well. The pH value should be around 5.5 to 6.",

If the tree is kept relatively cold during winter months, watering can be done as seldom as once every three weeks. Monitor your tree closely and water the moment the soil dries out slightly. The Jade Bonsai is not as particular about over-watering as most other succulents.",
    pruning: "Because the Jade tree is a succulent, it retains water in its trunk and branches. The water retention makes the tree limbs heavy which naturally bends the trunk and branches. It responds very well to pruning, and you should prune it regularly to force it to grow branches, especially in the lower part of the trunk. Do not use cut-paste on Jade trees. The nature of its trunk and branches make it very susceptible to rotting.",
    repotting: "Repotting a Jade tree should be done every-other-year in spring. Be sure to use a well-draining soil mixture and don't water the soil for about a week after repotting. This allows the cut or damaged roots to dry and callous. Watering after repotting leads to root rot, which can severely damage your jade tree.",

    disease: "The bougainvillea tends to be pest resistant as long as is kept healthy and free from wet soil conditions or lack of light. Weak plants can be attacked by powdery mildew, aphids, scale, mealy bug, white fly or caterpillars. In that case use specific pesticides and try to improve the conditions for your tree. When the flowers wilt, cut them off to prevent rot."

    ginko = Tree.create(
    name: "Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba)",
    image: "https://www.bonsaiempire.com/images/species-photos/bonsai-ginkgo.jpeg",
    placement: "Place the ginkgo outside all year round. It prefers a sunny position but young trees are better placed in semi-shade. The ginkgo can endure frost but when it is planted in a bonsai pot the rootball should be protected from very low temperatures. In spring the new leaves appear quite late and in most cases then there will be no night frost anymore. But if the weather broadcast should announce the possibility of night frosts, better protect ginkgo bonsai when they have already produced leaves, to avoid severe damages.",
    fertilizing: "Begin with fertilizing when the buds begin to open. Use high nitrogen fertilizer in spring to make the tree grow long shoots. Otherwise especially older ginkgo bonsai might only produce leaves on short shoots and the ramification will not improve. Use liquid fertilizer every week until the leaves turn yellow in autumn. Solid organic fertilizer can also be used. If the plant's vigour must be increased, use both, solid organic fertilizer and liquid fertilizer.",
    wiring: "Ginkgo trees can be wired at any time of the year. The branches are quite flexible. Take care not to damage the soft bark of the branches and twigs with the wire.",
    watering: "Ginkgos need much water from spring to autumn but must not be overwatered. Keep them slightly moist in winter. Calcareous water is no problem for the ginkgo.",
    pruning: "New long shoots should be shortened to one or two leaves when five or six have grown. Larger cut wounds don't heal well. Use cut paste and, if possible, avoid producing large wounds.",
    repotting: "Younger trees can be repotted every year in spring, older ones every two to five years. Don't prune the roots too heavily. A standard soil mix is fine, but it must be well-draining. The ginkgo tolerates a wide range of acidic to alkaline soils, the pH value can even be up to 10.",
    propagation: "The ginkgo tree can be propagated from seeds and cuttings. Air-layering is also possible. The seeds have a hard shell and should be stratified or scarified before they are planted. It can take two years until they germinate.",
    disease: "The ginkgo is very resistant and is hardly ever attacked by insects or fungal diseases."

    umbrella = Tree.create(
    name: "Hawaiian umbrella (Schefflera arboricola)",
    image: "https://www.bonsaiempire.com/images/species/hawaiian-umbrella-Schefflera.jpg",
    placement: "The Dwarf Umbrella Bonsai can be kept inside the house all the year round. Ideal temperatures are 18° C to 22° C / 65° F to 72° F. Schefflera Bonsai can tolerate low humidity and dim light but they grow much better and produce smaller leaves if they get much light. The temperature should not fall below 10° C / 50° F. If the windows are opened for ventilation in winter, take care that the tree is not exposed to cold draught.",
    fertilizing: "Use liquid fertilizer every week from spring to autumn and once a month in winter, regarding the dosing instruction. During summer you can also use solid organic fertilizer.",
    wiring: "The Dwarf Umbrella Tree produces no hard wood and their trunks and branches are likely to snap when you try to bend them too strongly. Younger shoots are more flexible and can be wired and shaped with less risk of breaking them.",
    watering: "The Hawaiian umbrella Bonsai likes a moist soil which must not dry out. In winter it should be watered more cautiously, but if the tree is placed above a heating device, take good care that the rootball does not dry out.",
    pruning: "Dwarf Umbrella Bonsai trees can be developed well with thoughtful pruning. A new shoot will point in the same direction like the leaf that is located directly below the cut, growing from its axil.  Very healthy trees can be defoliated and at the same time the tips of the twigs shout be cut off. This results in lots of new shoots, increasing ramification and smaller leaves.",
    repotting: "Repot every second year in spring. Be careful with the fleshy roots which break easily. Use a standard soil mix.",
    propagation: "The Dwarf Umbrella Tree can be propagated from seeds and cuttings. Cuttings will root in soil or even in a glass of water.",
    disease: "The tree is not often attacked by insects. Scale can occasionally occur. In that case use a specific oil-based insecticide."
